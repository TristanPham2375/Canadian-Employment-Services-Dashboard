# üá®üá¶ Canada Employment & Essential Services Dashboard

This interactive Dash application visualizes employment statistics and essential services across Canadian provinces and territories. Developed as part of a data-driven education toolkit focused on the **UN Sustainable Development Goal: Zero Hunger**, this dashboard helps users critically analyze the distribution of key occupations and resources relevant to food security and sustainable development.

## üîç Project Overview

This project consists of **four separate Dash apps**, each focusing on a unique analytical question. All visualizations are based on real Canadian census and labor data, supporting data-driven decision-making and learning.

The four key tasks are:

1. **Essential Services Choropleth Map**
2. **Gender Distribution by Occupation**
3. **EV Production Manpower by Engineering Field**
4. **Natural Science Graduate Composition**

Each Dash app runs independently and provides interactive features such as dropdown filters and dynamic charts.
