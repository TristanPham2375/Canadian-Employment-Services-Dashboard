The four key tasks are:

1. **Essential Services Choropleth Map**
2. **Gender Distribution by Occupation**
3. **EV Production Manpower by Engineering Field**
4. **Natural Science Graduate Composition**

Each Dash app runs independently and provides interactive features such as dropdown filters and dynamic charts.
